My name is Namitha. Welcome to my blog! My background is in information and communication system engineering. I graduated from Makers Academy Remote  in order to continue my career in software & web development. <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/" target="_blank">Makers Academy</a> is the European leading bootcamp providing an intense 4 months practical training, simulating an agile corporation environment and applying agile techniques such as user stories, weekly retrospectives, XP values, pair programming or scrum teams, and learning by coding using languages such as Ruby or JavaScript. It was very intense, working long hours to succeed on the challenges, and I loved it.

Previously I am working for multinational company in India, after getting maried I moved to London, due to family commitments I took a break from work for a couple of years but I continued to learn with online courses throughout that time. But now I am very happy to start my coding journey all again.

I am also very interested in the other framework, and currently learning MongoDB for nodejs by myself, using the fantastic resources available at <a href="https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M101JS/about/" target="_blank">MongoDB University</a>.  But I am also interested by Web technologies such as JavaScript, Angular and of course Ruby and Ruby on Rails!

> My desire is to get a developer role where I can continuously learn and become a truly respected professional in the field.
